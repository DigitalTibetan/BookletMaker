## Installation and Build

Either clone the source code and use Xcode to build the application, or use the provided ready-to-run application.

### Install release version

The 'Releases' area (on the right) includes the latest pre-compiled version of BookletMaker for macOS versions 10.13 and newer, latest tested version is macOS Tahoe 26.1.

- Download [Booklet-maker.zip](https://github.com/DigitalTibetan/BookletMaker/releases/download/0.3/Booklet-maker.zip), currently 0.3.
- Unpack the archive and try to start Booklet-maker.app.
- Since the application is not signed, you will get the options to trash the application, or press 'Done'. Press Done.
- Now to allow the start of the app:
- In macOS "System Settings", go to "Privacy and Security", scroll all the way down, until you see an option to "Start anyway".
- After yet another suggestion to move the application to trash, or start, it should finally work.

Remember, the full source code is available in this repository, and you can always build the entire application yourself and provide your own signing keys.
